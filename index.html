      <h2 id="hello">Hello!</h2>

<p>My name is Rodrigo! Iâ€™m a ....</p>

<!--

<p>Previously, I was a Software Engineer at Google working in ML models and infrastructure that power multiple features in Google Assistant. I was also a 20% Product Manager in the <a href="https://github.com/tensorflow/graphics">TensorFlow Graphics</a> team.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve always loved to share my knowledge with others, so I try to give talks whenever possible. This also led me to create <a href="https://www.meetup.com/AI-Learners/">AI Learners</a>, a non-profit Spanish-speaking community in which we offered talks and workshops on topics such as Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision for people of all levels of knowledge.</p>

<h3 id="working-at-hugging-face">Working at Hugging Face</h3>

<p>My work has a bit of everything:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Integrating third-party libraries such as <a href="https://hf.co/blog/spacy">spaCy</a> and <a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/sentence-transformers-in-the-hub">Sentence Transformers</a> to the Hub.</li>
  <li>Helped with increasing the usage of the Hub. 9000 to 18000 repos in just 5 months!</li>
  <li>Co-organized community events such as a great Flax sprint and the <a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/collaborative-training">Collaborative Training</a>.</li>
  <li>and lots of cool nice stuff I would love to share with you</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="workshops-given-by-me-mix-of-spanish-and-english">Workshops given by me (mix of Spanish and English)</h3>

<p>If you want to invite me to give a workshop/conference/talk, happy to do so! Please reach out to me to omar at huggingface.co.</p>
